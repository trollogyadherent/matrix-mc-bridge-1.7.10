# Matrix Minecraft Bridge 1.7.10 (Forge)
Simple bridge using the [Matrix-ClientServer-API-java](https://github.com/JojiiOfficial/Matrix-ClientServer-API-java) library. It is minimalist enough that understanding the code shouldn't be a hassle, and is easy to modify.
The mod [DiscordIntegration](https://github.com/MiraWaNeko/DiscordIntegration/tree/v3/mc1.7) by MiraWaNeko has been used for help and some snippets.
Mod template provided by [Forge-MDK](https://github.com/basdxz/Forge-MDK).
